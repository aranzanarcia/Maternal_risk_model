### Introduction
Maternal Risk Prediction is a web application that predicts the risk level for pregnant women based on certain health metrics. The application uses Random Forest Classifier model to analyze these metrics and provide personalized advice to help mitigate potential risks.

### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to provide timely predictions and advice to improve maternal health outcomes. By analyzing key health parameters, the application aims to identify potential risk level early and offer advice.

### Features
- Risk Prediction: Predicts the risk level based on health metrics such as age, blood pressure, blood sugar, body temperature, and heart rate.
- Personalized Advice: Provides customized advice based on the predicted risk level using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model.
- User-Friendly Interface: A simple and intuitive web interface for data input and viewing results.
  
### Data Collection
The application requires the following input parameters:
- Age
- Blood Pressure (e.g., 120/80)
- Blood Sugar (in mmol/l)
- Body Temperature (in Â°F)
- Heart Rate

### Model Description
The project uses a Random Forest Classifier trained on a dataset with various health parameters. The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy and recall metrics to ensure reliable predictions.

### Future Work
- Incorporate more health parameters to improve the accuracy of the predictions.
- Add more samples to training data to improve predictions.
- Enhance the advice generation to cover a broader range of potential health scenarios.
- Implement user authentication and data storage for personalized health tracking.

### Contributions
Contributions are welcome, however for personal reasons the code is not being displayed publicly in this repository, but I can happily share it with anyone who asks for it.
